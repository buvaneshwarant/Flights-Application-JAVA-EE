# Flights-Application-JAVA-EE
In this course we are going to build an airline application using JAVA EE. We are going to be able to create flights, and passentgers will be able to register and buy tickets to flights. There'll be an airplane associated with each fligt, and flights will have origin and destination and so on.
The purpose of working on this application is to work on Java EE technologies.
1) Servlet and JSP (WEB APPS)
2) EJB (ENTERPRISE JAVA BEAN) - connect our web app to a robust server side system.
3) JPA (Java Persistence API) - database communication.
4) JAX-RS (REST Web Services) - expose our application so other application can connect and use.
5) CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) - basics, allows us to get access to serverside resources in our application.
